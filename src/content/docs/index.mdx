    AEPs are built on proven lessons from industry veterans at Google, Microsoft, Roblox, IBM (and others!) plus major contributors to HTTP and IETF specifications.

    Learn from their experience in crafting APIs that are easy to use, maintain, and evolve.
  </Card>

  <Card title="We have the clients" icon="puzzle">
    APIs that conform to the AEPs can take advantage of our Terraform provider, UI, CLI, and MCP server with zero-configuration. 
    The AEP standard is designed to work assuming a wide variety of clients, not just curl.
