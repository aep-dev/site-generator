# Long-running operations

Occasionally, a service may need to expose an operation that takes a
significant amount of time to complete. In these situations, it is often a poor
user experience to simply block while the task runs; rather, it is better to
return some kind of promise to the user, and allow the user to check back in
later.

The long-running request pattern is roughly analogous to a [Future][] in Python
or Java, or a [Node.js Promise][]. Essentially, the user is given a token that
can be used to track progress and retrieve the result.

## Guidance

Operations that might take a significant amount of time to complete <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b>
return a `202 Accepted` response along with an `Operation` resource that can be
used to track the status of the request and ultimately retrieve the result.

Any single operation defined in an API surface <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> either _always_ return
`202 Accepted` along with an `Operation`, or _never_ do so. A service **must
not** return a `200 OK` response with the result if it is "fast enough", and
`202 Accepted` if it is not fast enough, because such behavior adds significant
burdens for clients.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  User expectations can vary on what is considered "a significant
  amount of time" depending on what work is being done. A good rule of thumb is
  10 seconds.
</Aside>

### Operation representation

The response to a long-running request <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be an [`Operation`][Operation].


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  Protocol buffer APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> use the common component
  [`aep.api.Operation`][aep.api.Operation].
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  OpenAPI services <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> use this [`JSON Schema Operation`]JSON Schema
  Operation] schema.
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

### Querying an operation

The service <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> provide an endpoint to query the status of the operation,
which <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> accept the operation path and <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> include other
parameters:

```http
GET /v1/operations/{operation} HTTP/2
Host: library.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

The endpoint <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> return a `Operation` as described above.

### Standard methods

APIs <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> return an `Operation` from the [`Create`][aip-133],
[`Update`][aip-134], or [`Delete`][aip-135] standard methods if appropriate. In
this case, the `response` field <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be the standard and expected response
type for that standard method.

When creating or deleting a resource with a long-running request, the resource
<b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be included in [`List`][aip-132] and [`Get`][aip-131] calls;
however, the resource <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> indicate that it is not usable, generally with
a [state enum][aip-216].

### Parallel requests

A resource <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> accept multiple requests that will work on it in parallel,
but is not obligated to do so:

- Resources that accept multiple parallel requests <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> place them in a
  queue rather than work on the requests simultaneously.
- Resource that does not permit multiple requests in parallel (denying any new
  request until the one that is in progress finishes) <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> return
  `409 Conflict` if a user attempts a parallel request, and include an error
  message explaining the situation.

### Expiration

APIs <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> allow their operation resources to expire after sufficient time
has elapsed after the request completed.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  A good rule of thumb for operation expiry is 30 days.
</Aside>

### Errors

Errors that prevent a long-running request from _starting_ <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> return an
error response (AEP-193), similar to any other method.

Errors that occur over the course of a request <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be placed in the
metadata message. The errors themselves <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> still be represented with a
canonical error object.

## Interface Definitions


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  When using protocol buffers, the common component
  [`aep.api.Operation`][aep.api.Operation] is used.
  
  <Sample path="../aep.dev/aep/general/0151/lro.proto" type="protobuf" />
  
  - The response type <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be `aep.api.Operation`. The `Operation` proto
    definition <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> be copied into individual APIs; prefer to use a
    single copy (in monorepo code bases), or remote dependencies via a tool like
    [Buf][buf.build].
    - The response <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> be a streaming response.
  - The method <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> include a [`aep.api.operation_info`][lro] annotation,
    which <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> define both response and metadata types.
    - The response and metadata types <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be defined in the file where the
      RPC appears, or a file imported by that file.
    - If the response and metadata types are defined in another package, the
      fully-qualified message name <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be used.
    - The response type <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> be `google.protobuf.Empty` (except for
      [`Delete`][aip-135] methods), unless it is certain that response data will
      _never_ be needed. If response data might be added in the future, define an
      empty message for the RPC response and use that.
    - The metadata type is used to provide information such as progress, partial
      failures, and similar information on each `GetOperation` call. The metadata
      type <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> be `google.protobuf.Empty`, unless it is certain that
      metadata will _never_ be needed. If metadata might be added in the future,
      define an empty message for the RPC metadata and use that.
  - APIs with messages that return `Operation` <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> implement the
    `GetOperation` method of the [`Operations`][lro] service, and <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b>
    implement the other methods defined in that service. Individual APIs **must
    not** define their own interfaces for long-running operations to avoid
    inconsistency.
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  <Sample path="../aep.dev/aep/general/0151/lro.oas.yaml" type="yml" />
  
  - `202` <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be the only success status code defined.
  - The `202` response <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> define an `application/json` response body and no
    other response content types.
  - The response body schema <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be an object with `path`, `done`, `error`,
    and `response` properties as described above for an `Operation`.
  - The response body schema <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> contain an object property named `metadata`
    to hold service-specific metadata associated with the operation, for example
    progress information and common metadata such as create time. The service
    <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> define the contents of the `metadata` object in a separate schema,
    which <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> specify `additionalProperties: true` to allow for future
    extensibility.
  - The `response` property <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be a schema that defines the success
    response for the operation. For an operation that typically gives a
    `204 No Content` response, such as a `Delete`, `response` should be defined
    as an empty object schema. For a standard `Get/Create/Update` operation,
    `response` should be a representation of the resource.
  - If a service has any long running operations, the service <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> define an
    `Operation` resource with a `list` operation to retrieve a potentially
    filtered list of operations and a `get` operation to retrieve a specific
    operation by its `path`.
