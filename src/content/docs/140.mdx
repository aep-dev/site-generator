# Field names

Naming fields in a way that is intuitive to users can often be one of the most
challenging aspects of designing an API. This is true for many reasons; often a
field name that seems entirely intuitive to the author can baffle a reader.

Additionally, users rarely use only one API; they use many APIs together. As a
result, a single company using the same name to mean different things (or
different names to mean the same thing) can often cause unnecessary confusion,
because users can no longer take what they've already learned from one API and
apply that to another.

In short, APIs are easiest to understand when field names are simple,
intuitive, and consistent with one another.

## Guidance

Field names <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be in correct American English.

Field names <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> clearly and precisely communicate the concept being
presented and avoid overly general names that are ambiguous. That said, field
names <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> avoid including unnecessary words. In particular, avoid
including adjectives that always apply and add little cognitive value. For
example, a `proxy_settings` field might be as helpful as
`shared_proxy_settings` if there is no unshared variant.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Field names often appear in generated client surfaces. Ensure
  they are appropriately descriptive and of suitable length.
</Aside>

### Case


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  Field definitions in protobuf files <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> use `lower_snake_case` names.
  These names are mapped to an appropriate naming convention in JSON and in
  generated code.
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  Field definitions in OAS schemas <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> use `camelCase` names.
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Examples throughout this AEP use `snake_case`. This should not be
  taken to mean that this guidance is protobuf-specific. Any guidance not in a
  protobuf tab applies to all APIs, with `snake_case` examples converted to
  `camelCase` for OAS APIs.
</Aside>

Each word in a field name <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> begin with a number, because it creates
ambiguity when converting between snake case and camel case. Similarly, fields
<b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> contain leading, trailing, or adjacent underscores.

### Uniformity

APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> endeavor to use the same name for the same concept and
different names for different concepts wherever possible. This includes names
across multiple APIs, in particular if those APIs are likely to be used
together.

### Arrays / Repeated fields

Arrays (in OAS) and repeated fields (in protobuf) <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> use the proper
plural form, such as `books` or `authors`. On the other hand, singular fields
<b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> use the singular form such as `book` or `author`.

### Prepositions

Field names <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> include prepositions (such as "with", "for", "at",
"by", etc.). For example:

- `error_reason` (**not** `reason_for_error`)
- `author` (**not** `written_by`)

It is easier for field names to match more often when following this
convention. Additionally, prepositions in field names may also indicate a
design concern, such as an overly-restrictive field or a sub-optimal data type.
This is particularly true regarding "with": a field named `book_with_publisher`
likely indicates that the book resource may be improperly structured and worth
redesigning.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  The word "per" is an exception to this rule, particularly in two
  cases. Often "per" is part of a unit (e.g. "miles per hour"), in which case the
  preposition must be present to accurately convey the unit. Additionally, "per"
  is often appropriate in reporting scenarios (e.g. "nodes per instance" or
  "failures per hour").
</Aside>

### Adjectives

For uniformity, field names that contain both a noun and an adjective
<b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> place the adjective _before_ the noun. For example:

- `collected_items` (**not** `items_collected`)
- `imported_objects` (**not** `objects_imported`)

### Verbs

Field names <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> be named to reflect an intent or action. They **must
not** be verbs.

Rather, because the field defines the _desired value_ for mutations, e.g.
Create and Update, and the _current value_ for reads, e.g. Get and List, the
name <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be a noun. It defines what is so, not what to do.

- `collected_items` (**not** `collect_items`)
- `disabled` (**not** `disable`)

In contrast, method names, whether standard or custom, change facets of
resources and are named as verbs.

### Booleans

Boolean fields <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> omit the prefix "is". For example:

- `disabled` (**not** `is_disabled`)
- `required` (**not** `is_required`)

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Field names that would otherwise be [reserved words](#reserved-words)
  are an exception to this rule. For example, `is_new` (**not** `new`).
</Aside>

### String vs. bytes


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  When using `bytes`, the contents of the field are base64-encoded when using
  JSON on the wire. APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> use `bytes` when there is a need to send
  binary contents over the wire, and <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> ask the user to manually
  base64-encode a field into a `string` field.
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  **Note:** OAS guidance not yet written.
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

### URIs

Field names representing URLs or URIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> always use `uri` rather than
`url`. This is because while all URLs are URIs, not all URIs are URLs. Field
names <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> use a prefix in front of `uri` as appropriate.

### Reserved words

Field names <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> avoid using names that are likely to conflict with
keywords in common programming languages, such as `new`, `class`, `function`,
`import`, etc. Reserved keywords can cause hardship for developers using the
API in that language.

### Conflicts

Schemas <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> include a field with the same name as the enclosing
schema (ignoring case transformations). This causes conflicts when generating
code in some languages.

### Display names

Many resources have a human-readable name, often used for display in UI. This
field <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be called `display_name`, and <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> have a uniqueness
requirement.

If an entity has an official, formal name (such as a company name or the title
of a book), an API <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> use `title` as the field name instead. The `title`
field <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> have a uniqueness requirement.
