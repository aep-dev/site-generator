# Get

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a resource's URI (for
example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in order to retrieve that
resource.

Resource-oriented design (AEP-121) honors this pattern through the `Get`
method. These RPCs accept the URI representing that resource and return the
resource.

## Guidance

 - APIs **must** provide a get method for resources. The purpose of the get method
is to return data from a single resource.
 - Some resources take longer to be retrieved than is reasonable for a regular API request. In this situation, the API should use a [long-running operation](/long-running-operations).

### Requests

`Get` operations **must** be made by sending a `GET` request to the resource's
URI:

```http
GET /v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book} HTTP/2
Host: library.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

- The HTTP method **must** be `GET`.
  - The request **must** be safe and **must not** have side effects.
- There **must not** be a request body.
  - If a `GET` request contains a body, the body **must** be ignored, and
    **must not** cause an error.
- The request **must not** require any fields in the query string. The request
  **should not** include optional fields in the query string unless described
  in another AEP.

### Responses

Single-resource `GET` operations **must** return the resource itself, without
any additional wrapping:

```json
{
  "name": "publishers/lacroix/books/les-mis",
  "isbn": "978-037-540317-0",
  "title": "Les Mis√©rables",
  "authors": ["Victor Hugo"],
  "rating": 9.6
}
```

The response **should** usually include the fully-populated resource unless
there is a reason to return a partial response (see AEP-157).

### Errors

If the user does not have sufficient permission to know that the resource
exists, the service **should** reply with an HTTP 404 error, regardless of
whether or not the resource exists. Permission **must** be checked prior to
checking if the resource exists.

If the user has sufficient permission to know that the resource exists, but is
unable to access it, the service **should** reply with an HTTP 403 error.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist, the service **must** reply with an HTTP 404 error.

  - The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Get`. The remainder of the RPC
    name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
  - The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `Request` suffix.
  - The response message **must** be the resource itself. (There is no
    `GetBookResponse`.)
  - The HTTP verb **must** be `GET`.
  - The URI **should** contain a single variable field corresponding to the
    resource path.
    - This field **should** be called `path`.
    - The URI **should** have a variable corresponding to this field.
    - The `path` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
      remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
  - There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.
  - There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
    with a value of `"path"`.
  
  Get operations also implement a common request message pattern:

  - A resource path field **must** be included. It **should** be called `path`.
    - The field **should** be annotated as `REQUIRED`.
    - The field **should** identify the [resource type][aep-123] that it
      references.
  - The comment for the `path` field **should** document the resource pattern.
  - The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
    **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in
    another AEP.
  
  **Note:** The `path` field in the request object corresponds to the `path`
  variable in the `google.api.http` annotation on the RPC. This causes the `path`
  field in the request to be populated based on the value in the URL when the
  REST/JSON interface is used.
