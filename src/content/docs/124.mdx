# Resource association

APIs sometimes have resource relationships that can not be cleanly expressed in
a hierarchical structure. For example, a resource may have a many-to-one
relationship with two other resource types instead of just one. Alternatively,
a resource may have a many-to-many relationship with another resource type.

## Guidance

A resource <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> have at most one canonical parent, and `List` requests
<b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> require two distinct "parents".

### Multiple many-to-one associations

If a resource has a many-to-one relationship with multiple resource types, it
<b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> choose at most one of them to be the parent. The resource <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be
associated with other resources through other fields on the resource.

  </TabItem>

When listing resources with multiple associations in this way, the RPC <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b>
treat the `string parent` field as required as discussed in [list](/list), and
<b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> add additional required arguments. The RPC <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> include a
`string filter` field that allows users to filter by other resource
associations as discussed in [filtering](/filtering).

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Resource reference fields <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> accept the
  [resource path](/resource-path) of the referenced resource.
</Aside>

### Many-to-many associations

Many-to-many associations are less common in APIs than they are in relational
databases, in part because they are more difficult to model and present over
network interfaces.

An API <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> contain many-to-many relationships, and <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> use a
repeated field containing a list of resource paths, following the principles
described for repeated fields in [arrays][/arrays].

  <Sample path="../aep.dev/aep/general/0124/many_to_many_repeated.proto" type="protobuf" token1="message Book" token2="" />
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  <Sample path="../aep.dev/aep/general/0124/many_to_many_repeated.oas.yaml" type="yml" token1="Book" token2="" />
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  See [arrays](/arrays) for more information on repeated fields,
  including how to handle common issues such as atomic changes.
</Aside>

If the use of a repeated field is too restrictive, or if more metadata is
required along with the association, an API <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> model a many-to-many
relationship using a sub-resource with two one-to-many associations.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  <Sample path="../aep.dev/aep/general/0124/many_to_many_subresource.proto" type="protobuf" token1="message BookAuthor" token2="" />
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  <Sample path="../aep.dev/aep/general/0124/many_to_many_subresource.oas.yaml" type="yml" token1="BookAuthor" token2="" />
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Using subresources to model an association between resources is only
  recommended if additional metadata is required in the relationship, or if the
  restrictions around the use of a repeated field preclude the use of that
  approach.
</Aside>

### Embedded resources

Resource references as described use string references rather than embedding
one resource inside another because embedding resources can lead to a number of
issues. Retrieving resources with arbitrarily deep nesting may require multiple
serial internal RPCs, leading to complex service dependencies, latency, and
reliability issues.

However, sometimes dereferencing resource references is useful, or even
necessary.

For example, an API may wish to allow filtering of a resource based on a field
of a resource it references. This can be necessary in order to satisfy a query
expressing something like "list books written by authors who were born before
1950", where the author's birth date is a field on the `Author` resource
referenced by the `Book` resource.

In other cases, it may be much cheaper and/or faster for the server to perform
the dereferencing than for the client to make multiple serial requests.

In these cases, an alternative resource association pattern <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be used,
where the resource reference field is not a string, but is instead the
referenced resource itself.

The default behavior <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be to populate only the `path` field of the
referenced resource, making it equivalent to a string-based resource reference.
Additional fields <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be included based on the request: for example, if the
request includes a [view or read mask](./partial-responses) that specifies that
additional fields should be included, or if the request contains a filter that
specifies fields other than `path` within the referenced resource.

Fields other than `path` in embedded resource references <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be treated as
[output-only](./field-behavior); mutating API methods <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> allow
creating or mutation of embedded resources. For example, if a `Book` resource
has an embedded resource reference to `Author`, the `UpdateBook` method **must
not** allow updating any fields of the `Author` resource other than
`Author.path` (which updates the reference itself, rather than the referenced
resource).

APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> always fully document their behavior with embedded resources,
even if the only supported behavior is populating only the `path` field. If the
referenced resource itself contains embedded resources, the API <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b>
include clear documentation about the depth to which embedded resources may be
dereferenced.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  There is no need for the _referenced_ resource to define a
  `PATH_ONLY` [view](./partial-responses) corresponding to the default behavior
  of populating only the `path` field. This is because a resource should not have
  to define a view enum simply because another resource references it.
