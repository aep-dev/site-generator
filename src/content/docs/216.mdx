# States

Many API resources carry a concept of "state": ordinarily, the resource's place
in its lifecycle. For example, a virtual machine may be being provisioned,
available for use, being spun down, or potentially be in one of several other
situations. A job or query may be preparing to run, be actively running, have
completed, and so on.

## Guidance

Resources needing to communicate their state <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> use an enum, which
<b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be called `State` (or, if more specificity is required, end in the
word `State`). This enum <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be nested within the message it describes
when only used as a field within that message.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  We use the term `State`, and _not_ `Status` (which is reserved
  for the HTTP and gRPC statuses).
</Aside>

### Enum values

Ideally, APIs use the same terminology throughout when expressing the same
semantic concepts. There are usually many words available to express a given
state, but our customers often use multiple APIs together, and it is easier for
them when our terms are consistent.

At a high level:

- Resources that are available for use are `ACTIVE` (preferred over terms such
  as "ready" or "available").
- Resources that have completed a (usually terminal) requested action use past
  participles (usually ending in `-ED`), such as `SUCCEEDED` (not
  "successful"), `FAILED` (not "failure"), `DELETED`, `SUSPENDED`, and so on.
- Resources that are currently undergoing a state change use present
  participles (usually ending in `-ING`), such as `RUNNING`, `CREATING`,
  `DELETING`, and so on. In this case, it is expected that the state is
  temporary and will resolve to another state on its own, with no further user
  action.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Only add states that are useful to customers. Exposing a
  large number of states simply because they exist in your internal system is
  unnecessary and adds confusion for customers. Each state <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> come with a
  use case for why it is necessary.
</Aside>

### Output only

The field referencing the `State` enum in a resource <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> behave and be
documented as "Output only", in accordance with
[field behavior documentation](./field-behavior-documentation).

APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> allow a `State` enum to be directly updated through an
"update" method (or directly set through the "create" method), and <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b>
instead use custom state transition methods.

This is because update methods are generally not expected to have side effects,
and also because updating state directly implies that it is possible to set the
state to any available value, whereas states generally reflect a resource's
progression through a lifecycle.

### State transition methods

State transition methods are a special type of
[custom method](./custom-methods) that are responsible for transitioning a
state field from one enum value to another. As part of the transition, other
fields may also change, e.g. an `update_time` field. In addition to the general
guidance for custom methods on resources, the following guidance applies for
method definitions:

- The name of the method <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be a verb followed by the singular form of
  the resource's message name.
- The HTTP verb <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be `POST`.

In addition to the general guidance for custom methods on resources, the
following guidance applies for request definitions:

- A resource path field <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be included. It <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be called `path`.
- The comment for the field <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> document the resource pattern.
- Other fields <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be included.

  ```proto

  rpc PublishBook(PublishBookRequest) returns (Book) {
    option (google.api.http) = {
      post: "/v1/{path=publishers/*/books/*}:publish"

  ```
  
  - The request message <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> match the RPC name, with a `Request` suffix.
  - The response message <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be the resource itself.
    - If the RPC is [long-running](./lro), the response message <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be an
      `aep.api.Operation` which resolves to the resource itself.
  - The `body` clause in the `google.api.http` annotation <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be `"*"`.
  - The request message field receiving the resource path <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> map to the
    URI path.
    - This field <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be called `path`.
    - The `path` field <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> be the only variable in the URI path. All
      remaining parameters <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> map to URI query parameters.
  - If the state transition is not allowed, the service <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> error with
    `FAILED_PRECONDITION` (HTTP 400).
  
  The request message should look like this:
  
  ```proto
  message PublishBookRequest {
    // The path of the book to publish.
    // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}

## Additional Guidance

### Value uniqueness

Multiple top-level enums within the same package <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> not share the same
values. This is because the C++ protoc code generator flattens top-level enum
values into a single namespace.

State enums <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> live inside the resource definition.

### Prefixes

Using a `STATE_` prefix on every enum value is unnecessary. State enum values
<b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> be prefixed with the enum name, except for the default value
`STATE_UNSPECIFIED`.

### Breaking changes

<Aside type="tip" title="undefined">
  Clearly communicate to users that state enums may receive new values
  in the future, and be conscientious about adding states to an existing enum.
</Aside>

Even though adding states to an existing states enum _can_ break existing user
code, adding states is not considered a breaking change. Consider a state with
only two values: `ACTIVE` and `DELETED`. A user may add code that checks
`if state == ACTIVE`, and in the else cases simply assumes the resource is
deleted. If the API later adds a new state for another purpose, that code will
break.

API documentation <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> actively encourage users to code against state
enums with the expectation that they may receive new values in the future.

APIs <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> add new states to an existing State enum when appropriate, and
adding a new state is _not_ considered a breaking change.

### When to avoid states

Sometimes, a `State` enum may not be what is best for your API, particularly in
situations where a state has a very small number of potential values, or when
states are not mutually exclusive.

Consider the example of a state with only `ACTIVE` and `DELETED`, as discussed
above. In this situation, the API may be better off exposing a
`google.protobuf.Timestamp delete_time`, and instructing users to rely on
whether it is set to determine deletion.

### Common states

The following is a list of states in common use. APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> consider prior
art when determining state names, and <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> value local consistency above
global consistency in the case of conflicting precedent.

#### Resting states

"Resting states" are lifecycle states that, absent user action, are expected to
remain indefinitely. However, the user can initiate an action to move a
resource in a resting state into certain other states (resting or active).

- `ACCEPTED`
- `ACTIVE`
- `CANCELLED`
- `DELETED`
- `FAILED`
- `SUCCEEDED`
- `SUSPENDED`
- `VERIFIED`

#### Active states

"Active states" are lifecycle states that typically resolve on their own into a
single expected resting state.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Remember only to expose states that are useful to customers. Active
  states are valuable only if the resource will be in that state for a sufficient
  period of time. If state changes are immediate, active states are not
  necessary.
</Aside>

- `CREATING` (usually becomes `ACTIVE`)
- `DELETING` (usually becomes `DELETED`)
- `PENDING` (usually becomes `RUNNING`)
- `REPAIRING` (usually becomes `ACTIVE`)
- `RUNNING` (usually becomes `SUCCEEDED`)
- `SUSPENDING` (usually becomes `SUSPENDED`)
