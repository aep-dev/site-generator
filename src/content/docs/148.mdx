# Standard fields

Certain concepts are common throughout any corpus of APIs. In these situations,
it is useful to have a standard field name and behavior that is used
consistently to communicate that concept.

## Guidance

Standard fields <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be used to describe their corresponding concept, and
<b class="text-yellow-700">should not</b> be used for any other purpose.

### Resource paths and IDs

#### path

Every resource <b class="text-red-700">must</b> have a `string path` field, used for the
[resource path](/resource-paths), which <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be the first field in the
resource.

#### parent

The `string parent` field refers to the resource name of the parent of a
collection, and <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be used in [`List`](/list) and [`Create`](/create)
requests except for top-level resources.

### Names

#### display_name

The `string display_name` field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be a mutable, user-settable field
where the user can provide a human-readable name to be used in user interfaces.

Display names <b class="text-yellow-700">should not</b> have uniqueness requirements, and <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be
limited to \<= 63 characters.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  The `_name` suffix <b class="text-yellow-700">should not</b> be used to describe other types of
  names unless otherwise covered in this AEP.
</Aside>

#### title

The `string title` field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be the official name of an entity, such as
a company's name. This is a more formal variant of `string display_name`.

#### given_name

The `string given_name` field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> refer to a human or animal's given name.
Resources <b class="text-red-700">must not</b> use `first_name` for this concept, because the given
name is not placed first in many cultures.

#### family_name

The `string family_name` field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> refer to a human or animal's family
name. Resources <b class="text-red-700">must not</b> use `last_name` for this concept, because the
family name is not placed last in many cultures.

### Timestamps

See [common components](/common-components) for more information about `Timestamp` and
`Duration`.

#### create_time

The output only `Timestamp create_time` field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> represent the timestamp
when the resource was created. This <b class="text-green-700">may</b> be either the time creation was
initiated or the time it was completed.

#### update_time

The output only `Timestamp update_time` field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> represent the timestamp
when the resource was most recently updated. Any change to the resource made by
users <b class="text-red-700">must</b> refresh this value; changes to a resource made internally by the
service <b class="text-green-700">may</b> refresh this value.

#### delete_time

The output only `Timestamp delete_time` field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> represent the timestamp
that a resource was soft deleted. This <b class="text-green-700">may</b> correspond to either the time
when the user requested deletion, or when the service successfully soft deleted
the resource. If a resource is not soft deleted, the `delete_time` field
<b class="text-red-700">must</b> be empty.

Resources that support [soft delete](/soft-delete) <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> provide this field.

#### expire_time

The `Timestamp expire_time` field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> represent the time that a given
resource or resource attribute is no longer useful or valid (e.g. a rotating
security key). It <b class="text-green-700">may</b> be used for [expiration](/resource-expiration).

Services <b class="text-green-700">may</b> provide an `expire_time` value that is inexact, but the
resource <b class="text-red-700">must not</b> expire before that time.

#### purge_time

The `Timestamp purge_time` field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> represent the time when a soft
deleted resource will be purged from the system (see AEP-164). It <b class="text-green-700">may</b> be
used for similar forms of expiration as described in AEP-214. Resources that
support soft delete <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> include this field.

Services <b class="text-green-700">may</b> provide a `purge_time` value that is inexact, but the resource
<b class="text-red-700">must not</b> be purged from the system before that time.

### Well known string fields

#### IP address

A field that represents an IP address <b class="text-red-700">must</b> comply with the following:

- use type `string`
- use the name `ip_address` or end with the suffix `_ip_address` e.g.
  `resolved_ip_address`
- specify the IP address version format via one of the supported formats
  `IPV4`, `IPV6`, or if it can be either, `IPV4_OR_IPV6` (see [fields](/fields)).

#### uid

The output only `string uid` field refers to a system-assigned unique
identifier for a resource. When provided, this field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be a [UUID4][]
and <b class="text-red-700">must</b> specify this format via the `UUID4` format extension (see
[fields](/fields)).

## Rationale

### Well known string fields

Some fields represent very well defined concepts or artifacts that sometimes
also have strict governance of their semantics. For such fields, presenting an
equally standardized API surface is important. This enables development of
improved API consumer tools and documentation, as well as a more unified user
experience across the platform.
