# Delete

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `DELETE` request to a resource's URI
(for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in order to delete
that resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AEP-121][aep-121]) honors this pattern through the
`Delete` method. This method accepts the URI representing that resource and
usually returns an empty response.

## Guidance

APIs <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> generally provide a delete method for resources unless it is
not valuable for users to do so.

The Delete method <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> succeed if and only if a resource was present and
was successfully deleted. If the resource did not exist, the method <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b>
send a `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`) error.

If the API is operating on the [Management Plane][], the method should have
[strong consistency][]: the completion of a delete method <b class="text-red-700">must</b> mean that
the existence of the resource has reached a steady-state and reading resource
state returns a consistent `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`) response.

Delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

- The method's name <b class="text-red-700">must</b> begin with the word `Delete`. The remainder of the
  method name <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be the singular form of the resource's name.
- The request schema name <b class="text-red-700">must</b> exactly match the method name, with a
  `Request` suffix.
- The response message <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be an empty object.
  - If the delete method is [long-running](#long-running-delete), the response
    schema <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be an `Operation` which resolves to the correct response.

    option (google.api.http) = {
      delete: "/v1/{path=publishers/*/books/*}"
    };
    option (google.api.method_signature) = "path";
  }
  ```
  
  - The response message <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be `google.protobuf.Empty`.
    - If the delete RPC is [long-running](#long-running-delete), the response
      message <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be a `aep.api.Operation` which resolves to the correct
      response.
  - The request message field receiving the resource path <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> map to the
    URI path.
    - This field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be called `path`.
    - The `path` field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be the only variable in the URI path. All

  - There <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
    with a value of `"path"`. If an etag or force field are used, they <b class="text-green-700">may</b> be
    included in the signature.

### Requests

Delete methods implement a common request pattern:

- The HTTP verb <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be `DELETE`.
- There <b class="text-red-700">must not</b> be a request body.
- If a delete request contains a body, the body <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be ignored, and **must
  not** cause an error (this is required by [RFC 9110][])
- The request <b class="text-red-700">must not</b> require any fields in the query string. The request
  <b class="text-yellow-700">should not</b> include optional fields in the query string unless described
  in another AEP.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">

      (google.api.resource_reference) = {
        type: "library.example.com/Book"
      }];
  }
  ```
  
  - A `path` field <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be included. It <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be called `path`.
    - The field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> be [annotated as required][aep-203].

      references.
  - The comment for the field <b class="text-yellow-700">should</b> document the resource pattern.
  - The request message <b class="text-red-700">must not</b> contain any other required fields, and

Some resources take longer to delete than is reasonable for a regular API

  long-running.

### Cascading delete

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to be able to delete a resource as
well as all applicable child resources. However, since deletion is usually
permanent, it is also important that users not do so accidentally, as
reconstructing wiped-out child resources may be quite difficult.

If an API allows deletion of a resource that may have child resources, the API
<b class="text-red-700">must</b> provide a `bool force` field on the request, which the user sets to
explicitly opt in to a cascading delete.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  ```proto
  message DeletePublisherRequest {
    // The path of the publisher to delete.
    // Format: publishers/{publisher}
    string path = 1 [
      (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
      (google.api.resource_reference) = {
        type: "library.example.com/Publisher"
      }];
  
    // If set to true, any books from this publisher will also be deleted.
    // (Otherwise, the request will only work if the publisher has no books.)
    bool force = 2;
  }
  ```

  is `false` (or unset) and child resources are present.

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service <b class="text-red-700">must</b> error with `403 Forbidden`
(`PERMISSION_DENIED`). Permission <b class="text-red-700">must</b> be checked prior to checking if the
resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist, the service <b class="text-red-700">must</b> error with `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`).
