# Delete

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `DELETE` request to a resource's URI
(for example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in order to delete
that resource.

Resource-oriented design ([AEP-121][aep-121]) honors this pattern through the
`Delete` method. This method accepts the URI representing that resource and
usually returns an empty response.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a delete method for resources unless it is
not valuable for users to do so.

The Delete method **should** succeed if and only if a resource was present and
was successfully deleted. If the resource did not exist, the method **should**
send a `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`) error.

If the API is operating on the [Management Plane][], the method should have
[strong consistency][]: the completion of a delete method **must** mean that
the existence of the resource has reached a steady-state and reading resource
state returns a consistent `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`) response.

Delete methods are specified using the following pattern:

- The method's name **must** begin with the word `Delete`. The remainder of the
  method name **should** be the singular form of the resource's name.
- The request schema name **must** exactly match the method name, with a
  `Request` suffix.
- The response message **should** be an empty object.
  - If the delete method is [long-running](#long-running-delete), the response
    schema **must** be an `Operation` which resolves to the correct response.

    option (google.api.http) = {
      delete: "/v1/{path=publishers/*/books/*}"
    };
    option (google.api.method_signature) = "path";
  }
  ```
  
  - The response message **should** be `google.protobuf.Empty`.
    - If the delete RPC is [long-running](#long-running-delete), the response
      message **must** be a `aep.api.Operation` which resolves to the correct
      response.
  - The request message field receiving the resource path **should** map to the
    URI path.
    - This field **should** be called `path`.
    - The `path` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
      remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
  - There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.
  - There **should** be exactly one `google.api.method_signature` annotation,
    with a value of `"path"`. If an etag or force field are used, they **may** be
    included in the signature.

### Requests

Delete methods implement a common request pattern:

- The HTTP verb **must** be `DELETE`.
- There **must not** be a request body.
- If a delete request contains a body, the body **must** be ignored, and **must
  not** cause an error (this is required by [RFC 9110][])
- The request **must not** require any fields in the query string. The request
  **should not** include optional fields in the query string unless described
  in another AEP.

  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  ```proto

      (google.api.resource_reference) = {
        type: "library.example.com/Book"
      }];
  }
  ```
  
  - A `path` field **must** be included. It **should** be called `path`.
    - The field **should** be [annotated as required][aep-203].
    - The field **must** identify the [resource type][aep-123] that it
      references.
  - The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.
  - The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
    **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
    or another AEP.

### Soft delete

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  This material was moved into its own document to provide a more
  comprehensive treatment: [AEP-164][aep-164].
</Aside>

### Long-running delete

Some resources take longer to delete than is reasonable for a regular API
request. In this situation, the API **should** use a long-running operation
instead: [AEP-151][aep-151].

- The `response` field of the response body **must** be an empty object to be
  consistent with the appropriate return type if the method was not
  long-running.

  ```proto
  rpc DeleteBook(DeleteBookRequest) returns (aep.api.Operation) {

    };
    option (aep.api.operation_info) = {
      response_type: "google.protobuf.Empty"
      metadata_type: "OperationMetadata"
    };
  }
  ```
  
  - The `response` field of the response **must** be `google.protobuf.Empty` to
    be consistent with the appropriate return type if the method was not
    long-running.
  - Both the `response_type` and `metadata_type` fields **must** be specified
    (even if they are `google.protobuf.Empty`).

  - The response status code should be `202 Accepted` if the request was accepted
    for later processing. When the request is processed it could still fail.
  - Both the `response_type` and `metadata_type` fields **must** be specified.

### Cascading delete

Sometimes, it may be necessary for users to be able to delete a resource as
well as all applicable child resources. However, since deletion is usually
permanent, it is also important that users not do so accidentally, as
reconstructing wiped-out child resources may be quite difficult.

If an API allows deletion of a resource that may have child resources, the API
**must** provide a `bool force` field on the request, which the user sets to
explicitly opt in to a cascading delete.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  ```proto
  message DeletePublisherRequest {
    // The path of the publisher to delete.
    // Format: publishers/{publisher}
    string path = 1 [
      (google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED,
      (google.api.resource_reference) = {
        type: "library.example.com/Publisher"
      }];
  
    // If set to true, any books from this publisher will also be deleted.
    // (Otherwise, the request will only work if the publisher has no books.)
    bool force = 2;
  }
  ```
  
  The API **must** fail with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error if the `force` field
  is `false` (or unset) and child resources are present.

  The API **must** fail with a `409 Conflict` error if the `force` field is
  `false` (or unset) and child resources are present.
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with `403 Forbidden`
(`PERMISSION_DENIED`). Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the
resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist, the service **must** error with `404 Not found` (`NOT_FOUND`).
