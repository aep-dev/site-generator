# Soft delete

There are several reasons why a client could desire soft delete and undelete
functionality, but one over-arching reason stands out: recovery from mistakes.
A service that supports undelete makes it possible for users to recover
resources that were deleted by accident.

## Guidance

Services **may** support the ability to "undelete", to allow for situations
where users mistakenly delete resources and need the ability to recover.

If a resource needs to support undelete, the `Delete` method **must** simply
mark the resource as having been deleted, but not completely remove it from the
system. If the method behaves this way, it **should** return `200 OK` with the
updated resource instead of `204 No Content`.

Resources that support soft delete **should** have an `expire_time` field as
described in AEP-148. Additionally, resources **should** include a `DELETED`
state value if the resource includes a `state` field (AEP-216).

### Undelete

A resource that supports soft delete **should** provide an `Undelete` method:

      message **must** be a `google.longrunning.Operation` which resolves to the

  - A `name` field **must** be included in the request message; it **should** be
    called `name`.
    - The field **should** be [annotated as required][aip-203].
    - The field **should** identify the [resource type][aip-123] that it
      references.
    - The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.
  - The request message **must not** contain any other required fields, and
    **should not** contain other optional fields except those described in this
    or another AEP.

### Long-running undelete

Some resources take longer to undelete a resource than is reasonable for a
regular API request. In this situation, the API **should** follow the
long-running request pattern (AEP-151).

### List and Get

Soft-deleted resources **should not** be returned in `List` (AEP-132) responses
by default (unless `bool show_deleted` is true).

A `Get` (AEP-131) request for a soft deleted resource **should** error with
`410 Gone` unless `bool show_deleted` is true, in which case soft-deleted
resources **must** return the resource.

Services that soft delete resources **may** choose a reasonable strategy for
purging those resources, including automatic purging after a reasonable time
(such as 30 days), allowing users to set an expiry time (AEP-214), or retaining
the resources indefinitely. Regardless of what strategy is selected, the
service **should** document when soft deleted resources will be completely
removed.

### Declarative-friendly resources

A resource that is declarative-friendly (AEP-128) **should** support soft
delete and undelete.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  There is an ambiguity in declarative tooling between "create"
  and "undelete". When given an alias which was previously deleted and a
  directive to make it exist, tooling usually does not know if the intent is to
  restore the previously-deleted resource, or create a new one with the same
  alias. Declarative tools **should** resolve this ambiguity in favor of creating
  a new resource: the only way to undelete is to explicitly use the undelete RPC
  (an imperative operation), and declarative tools **may** elect not to map
  anything to undelete at all.
</Aside>

Declarative-friendly resources **must** use long-running operations for both
soft delete and undelete. The service **may** return an LRO that is already set
to done if the request is effectively immediate.

Declarative-friendly resources **must** include `validate_only` (AEP-163) and
`etag` (AEP-154) in their `Undelete` methods.

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service **must** error with `403 Forbidden`.
Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist (either it was never created or already expunged), the service **must**
error with `404 Not Found`.

If the user calling a soft `Delete` has proper permission, but the requested
resource is already deleted, the service **must** succeed if `allow_missing` is
`true`, and **should** error with `404 Not Found` if `allow_missing` is
`false`.

If the user calling `Undelete` has proper permission, but the requested
resource is not deleted, the service **must** error with `409 Conflict`.
