Occasionally, a user may ask for a list of resources, and some set of resources
in the list are temporarily unavailable. For example, a user may ask to list
resources across multiple parent locations, but one of those locations is
temporarily unreachable. In this situation, it is still desirable to provide
the user with all the available resources, while indicating that something is
missing.

## Guidance

If a method to retrieve data is capable of partially failing due to one or more
resources being temporarily unreachable, the response message <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> include
a field to indicate this:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Protocol Buffers">
  
  
  ```proto
  message ListBooksResponse {
    // The books matching the request.
    repeated Book books = 1;
  
    // The next page token, if there are more books matching the
    // request.
    string next_page_token = 2;
  
    // Unreachable resources.
    repeated string unreachable = 3;
  }
  ```
  
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="OpenAPI 3.0">
  
  
  **Note:** OAS example note yet written.
  
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
    

- The field <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be a repeated string/string array, and <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be named
  `unreachable`.
- The field <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be set to the paths of the resources which are the cause
  of the issue, such as the parent or individual resources that could not be
  reached. The objects listed as unreachable <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be _parents_ (or higher
  ancestors) rather than the individual resources being requested. For example,
  if a location is unreachable, the location is listed.
  - The response <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> provide any other information about the issue,
    such as error details or codes. Toe enable users to discover what the
    underlying issue is, APIs <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> provide an API method that provides
    more specific information.
  - The service <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> provide a way for the user to get an error with
    additional information, and <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> allow the user to repeat the
    original call with more restrictive parameters in order to do so.
  - The resource paths provided in this field <b class="font-extrabold text-green-700">may</b> be heterogeneous. The
    field <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> document what potential resources may be provided in this
    field, and note that it might expand later.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  If a single unreachable location or resource prevents returning
  any data by definition (for example, a list request for a single publisher
  where that publisher is unreachable), the service <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> fail the entire
  request with an error.
</Aside>

### Pagination

When paginating over a list, it is likely that the service will not know that
there are unreachable parents or resources initially. Further, parents may
alternate between being available and unavailable in unpredictable ways
throughout the process of listing all the requested resources.

These facts lead to the following guidance:

- The response <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> provide any outstanding unreachable locations or
  resources in the `unreachable` field on pages _following_ the final page that
  contains a resource.
  - The response <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should not</b> include both requested data and unreachable
    resources on the same page.
    - For example, if there are two pages of books and one unavailable
      publisher, there should be three pages total: first the two pages of
      books, and then a final page with no books and the unavailable publisher.
  - If the number of unreachable resources to list is very large, the response
    <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b> honor the `max_page_size` field in the same way as for
    resources. In this case, all pages with requested information <b class="font-extrabold	text-yellow-700">should</b>
    precede all pages with unavailable resources or locations.
  - The final page's `unreachable` field <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> _only_ include resources or
    parents that were partially provided (or missing completely) across the
    entirety of the pagination process.
    - For example, if a parent or resource was unreachable at the beginning of
      pagination and it became reachable again and the entire set of previously
      unreachable data was provided to the user on any page, the `unreachable`
      field <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must not</b> include the intermittently-unreachable parent or
      resource.
    - On the other hand, if only _some_ of the resources for a given parent are
      provided during such an incident as described above, the parent or
      resource <b class="font-extrabold	text-red-700">must</b> be included in the `unreachable` field.
